{"name":"The Robotarium Project","tagline":"Now in closed alpha!","body":"# What is the Robotarium?\r\nThe Robotarium project's objective is to make an online robotics platform that is freely accessible to anyone. Robotics research currently involves multimillion dollar investment to participate. We believe that the people with the best ideas should win instead of those with the deepest pockets. In order to make that possible we are creating a remote robotics lab where anyone can upload code and test their ideas on real hardware.\r\n\r\n## How do I get involved?\r\nThe Robotarium is now open for business! Currently the Robotarium is in closed alpha. In order to be a tester contact [Zak Costello](mailto:zak.costello@gmail.com) or [Magnus Egerstedt](mailto:magnus@ece.gatech.edu).\r\n\r\n### Social Media \r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/robotariumorg)  \r\n\r\n[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC95etX3555MyNyOjoWHKFXg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
