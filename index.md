# What is the Robotarium?

The Robotarium is a remotely accessible multi-robot testbed that is freely available to anyone. The initial idea of creating the Robotarium was based on the observation that multi-robot testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the multi-agent research cycle, yet they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming to develop, operate, and maintain. The Robotarium removes this barrier to entrance by allowing users to access a state-of-the-art multi-robot test facility for free and from anywhere in the world. We believe that anyone with new, amazing ideas should be able to see their algorithms deployed on real robots, rather than purely simulated. To make this vision a reality, we have created a remote-access robotics lab where anyone can upload and test their ideas on real hardware.

# How to use the Robotarium?

The Robotarium is open for business in a limited alpha version. To execute your experiments on the Robotarium robots, contact [Daniel Pickem](mailto:daniel.pickem@gatech.edu) or [Magnus Egerstedt](mailto:magnus@gatech.edu). You can get started right away using the Robotarium simulator provided [here](/get_started/). A set of well-documented [examples](/examples/) will help you get started right away. In a nutshell, completing the following three steps is all that is required to run your experiment on the Robotarium:

1. Download the Robotarium's Matlab [simulator](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator)
2. Write and verify your script in the simulator
3. Contact either [Magnus Egerstedt](mailto:magnus@gatech.edu) or [Daniel Pickem](mailto:daniel.pickem@gatech.edu) for script submission instructions (optionally you can Skype in and watch your experiment as we execute it).
