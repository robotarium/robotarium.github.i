#What is the Robotarium?
The Robotarium project's objective is to make an online, robotics platform that remains freely accessible to anyone. Robotics research currently involves massive investments to competitively participate. However, we believe that anyone with new, amazing ideas should be able to see their algorithms deployed on real robots, rather than purely simulated. In order to make this vision possible, we are creating a remote-access, robotics lab where anyone can upload and test their ideas on real hardware.

#How do I get involved?
The Robotarium is now open for business! Currently the Robotarium is in closed alpha. In order to be a tester contact [Zak Costello](mailto:zak.costello@gmail.com) or [Magnus Egerstedt](mailto:magnus@gatech.edu). You can get started right away using the Robotarium simulator provided [here](/get_started/).
