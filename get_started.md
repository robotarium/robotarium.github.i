Currently, the robotarium supports MATLAB scripting to specify robot dynamics. Below we walk through a simple example which implements a cannonical algorithm in network control theory known as the consensus protocol. Download the example files [here](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator).  

# Running your code on real robots!

1. Download the Robotarium's [simulator](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator)
2. Write and verify your script in the simulator
3. Contact either [Magnus Egerstedt](mailto:magnus@gatech.edu) or [Daniel Pickem](mailto:daniel.pickem@gatech.edu) for script submission instructions

Note that any script or algorithm developed for the simulator ***can be run directly on the Robotarium!***  Furthermore, the simulator has been designed to closely approximate the physical behavior of the Robotarium's agents.
